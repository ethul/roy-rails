Package Roy as an alternate JS engine in the Rails Asset Pipeline.

## Basic Usage
- Include `roy-rails` in the Gemfile for your rails project.
- Place Roy source files under `app/assets/javascripts` with an extension of `.roy`
- Enjoy!

Generating Roy code with scaffolding also works.

## Coming Soon

Demo Rails application that uses Roy.
